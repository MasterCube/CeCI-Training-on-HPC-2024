|      |  The Slurm commands all start with the letter s. To better learn how to use them, it is useful to read their manual page (or man page for short).   |      |
|      |  Although the man pages are available on the web it is safer to refer to the manpage that are installed locally to make sure you are reading the    |      |
|      |  correct version with respect to the version of Slurm that you are interacting with.                                                                |      |

       ||   The workers are organised into partitions, sets of workers that share the same skills or are obey the same policies. For instance, there is a maximum    ||
       ||   time that a job is allowed to take before completion.                                                                                                    ||

       | Although an empty submission script is technically a valid submission script is most cases, it is not useful as is. There are two main sections that   |
       | are needed in the submission script.                                                                                                                   |

       | The first one is the description of the resources that your job will require. The most important resources to specify are                              |
       |                                                                                                                                                        |
       | - the needed number of CPUs ;                                                                                                                          |
       | - the required amount of memory.                                                                                                                       |
       |                                                                                                                                                        |
       | You also need to specify how long the job will need those resources. Remember that there is a limit on the maximum duration of a job!                  |
       |                                                                                                                                                        |
       | To specify a resource, you must include lines in the submission scripts, that start with #SBATCH and then the parameter name, followed by an optional  |
       | equal sign and its value.                                                                                                                              |
       |                                                                                                                                                        |

       |                                                                                                                                                        |
       | #SBATCH --time=10:00                                                                                                                                   |

       | There are unfortunately no magic solution to find out the correct amount of resources and duration for a given job as it will depend on many factors.  |
       | Only experience will tell you what amount of resource to request for a given job.                                                                      |

       | To fullfill this mission, insert in the submission script the three required lines to specify that the job should run for 10 minutes using 4 CPUs and  |
       | 1000MB of RAM per CPU.                                                                                                                                 |

In SLURM, the unit of the --mem-per-cpu option is megabytes (MB) by default.

This option is used to specify the amount of memory allocated per CPU core for a job. If your job has multiple CPUs, the total 
memory available to the job will be the value you provide multiplied by the number of CPUs requested.

Example:
bash

sbatch --mem-per-cpu=2048 --cpus-per-task=4 myscript.sh
In this example:

Each CPU core gets 2048 MB (2 GB) of memory.
Since --cpus-per-task=4 requests 4 CPUs, the total memory allocated to the job will be 4 × 2048 MB = 8192 MB (8 GB).
Specifying Units:
You can also explicitly specify the units by appending K, M, G, or T (for kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes).

Example with units:
bash

sbatch --mem-per-cpu=2G myscript.sh
Here, each CPU core gets 2 GB of memory.

Summary:
Default Unit: Megabytes (MB).
Custom Units: You can specify K (KB), M (MB), G (GB), or T (TB) if needed.

 | / |  The order in which the jobs are handled by Slurm depends on their priority. The priority is computed from multiple factors,   | \ |
 | / |  which can be discovered with sprio.                                                                                           | \ |
