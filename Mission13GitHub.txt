============                                                                                                                                        |\  | |/|

|       |   Next step is to be able to communicate with the github repo via secure connection (ssh).                                                            |       |
|       |   This step needs to be done only once for all your github repo.                                                                                      |       |

|       |   We advise to use a dedicated ssh key for github (and a unique one for each server/machine used).                                                    |       |
|       |   On the otherhand, we advised that you do not use a passphrase to avoid to type your password everytime.                                             |       |
|       |   (If you have an agent running, you can obviously put a passphrase).                                                                                 |       |

|       |   Step 1: Generate a (new and local) ssh key.                                                                                                         |       |

|       |    - Option 1: automatic setup:                                                                                                                       |       |

|       |   We have create a script for you to setup the code correctly.                                                                                        |       |

|       |   We will first ask you if you want to keep this ssh key only for the game or if you want to setup that key for the cluster that you are currently    |       |
|       |   using                                                                                                                                               |       |

|       |    1) create a .ssh directory in your home by running $> mkdir ~/.ssh                                                                                 |       |
|       |    2) create a new ssh key                                                                                                                            |       |

|       |   and enter (twice) the passphrase of your choice (just type enter twice to not have any passphrase).                                                 |       |
|       |    3) check the real path of the ~ directory [this step is only needed within gitshell]                                                               |       |

Congratulations, mission 13 has been successfully completed!

Congratulations for adding your ssh key
Your repo is still setup to use htpps protocol
to simplify our setup, the game has change your fork to use ssh protocol for the remote repository
MasterCube
new adress is now git@github.com:MasterCube/gitlectures.git
in future you can copy/paste directly the "ssh" adress of your fork
clean setup with check_true

|       |   The typical place for discussion on github is via issue and Pull Request.                                                                            |       |
|       |   Pull Request allow you to discuss a proposed changed of code modification.                                                                           |       |
|       |                                                                                                                                                        |       |
|       |   Your current mission is to propose to port back your change to the original github repo (the one that you clone from:                                |       |
|       |   https://github.com/oliviermattelaer/gitlectures).                                                                                                    |       |
|       |                                                                                                                                                        |       |
|       |   For that go to your github repo.                                                                                                                     |       |
|       |   then click on pull request and then on new pull request.                                                                                             |       |
|       |                                                                                                                                                        |       |
|       |   You will be able to choose which of your branch of your repo (in this case the master branch) you want to merge with which branch of your/another    |       |
|       |   repository. (you can target the master branch).                                                                                                      |       |
